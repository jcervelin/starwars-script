INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as
an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

             IMPERIAL OFFICER
      he Death Star plans are not in the
       main computer.

Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
in vain.

                  VADER
      Where are those transmissions you       intercepted?

Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

          d those plans and bri         me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
