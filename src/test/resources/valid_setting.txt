INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as
an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

                      IMPERIAL OFFICER
          The Death Star plans are not in the
          main computer.

Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
in vain.

                      VADER
          Where are those transmissions you
          intercepted?

Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

                      VADER
          What have you done with those plans?

                      REBEL OFFICER
          We intercepted no transmissions.
          Aaah... This is a consular ship.
          Were on a diplomatic mission.

                      VADER
          If this is a consular ship... were
          is the Ambassador?

The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
his troops.

                      VADER
          Commander, tear this ship apart until
          you've found those plans and bring
          me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
